# End-to-End Data Analysis in Microsoft Excel (Interactive Dashboard)

# Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow executed in Microsoft Excel, starting from raw data preparation and finishing with an interactive dashboard. The goal was to transform unstructured and inconsistent records into a decision-ready reporting layer using data cleaning, pivot-based segmentation, visual analytics, and slicer-enabled interactivity.

# Business Objective
Develop a self-serve Excel dashboard that enables quick exploration of demographic and behavioural patterns, answering questions such as:
	•	How do customer segments vary across income bands, age brackets, and commuting distance categories?
	•	What changes in patterns are visible when filtering by region or education level?
	•	Which segments demonstrate the strongest behavioural trends in the visuals?

# Dataset
The dataset was imported into Excel (CSV/Excel format) and included demographic and categorical fields such as income, age, commuting distance, region, and education. The dataset was structured and refined to ensure it could support accurate segmentation and reporting.

# Project Workflow (End-to-End)
	1.Data Cleaning and Standardisation
	•	Removed duplicate records to ensure reporting accuracy and prevent double counting.
	•	Standardised inconsistent category labels (e.g., variations in region/education naming) to improve data consistency.
	•	Validated data types and corrected formatting issues to ensure the dataset was analysis-ready.

	2.Pivot Table-Based Segmentation
  •	Built pivot tables to categorise and summarise demographics, enabling structured analysis across:
	•	Income bands
	•	Age brackets
	•	Commuting distance categories
	•	Designed pivots to support drill-down analysis and seamless dashboard connectivity.

	3.Visual Analytics and Insight Generation
	•	Developed dynamic visualisations, including:
	•	Bar charts for segment comparison
	•	Line charts for identifying directional patterns across ordered categories
	•	Ensured charts were directly driven by pivot outputs to maintain alignment between analysis and visual reporting.

	4.Interactive Dashboard Development
	•	Consolidated key insights into a single dashboard view designed for stakeholder-friendly consumption.
	•	Implemented slicers to enable interactive filtering by:
	•	Region
	•	Education
	•	Enabled fast decision-making through responsive visuals that update automatically based on slicer selections.

# Key Deliverables
	•	Cleaned and standardised dataset (deduplicated and analysis-ready)
	•	Pivot table segmentation across income, age, and commuting distance
	•	Dynamic charts connected to pivot outputs
	•	Interactive Excel dashboard with slicers for region and education filters

# Value Delivered
This project demonstrates strong capability in Excel-based analytics, including data preparation, segmentation modelling, visual storytelling, and dashboard design. The final output is a professional, portfolio-ready dashboard that supports self-serve exploration and business reporting.
